DaVinci Resolve for Linux can be picky about what format it accepts. 
Sometimes, video and audio doesn't work. Or the audio is muted when importing video files. 
This tool helps to solve this problem in your video editing workflow. 
So you can focus more on the actual editing.

Before converting (notice audio is broken):
